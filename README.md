# Energy-Tracking-System

This project develops a system for accurately measuring electricity consumption and facilitating precise billing for individual appliances using Java and JavaFX. 
The system captures real-time appliance-level power usage through smart metering infrastructure and provides detailed insights into energy consumption.
By analyzing consumption patterns, it enables transparent billing and promotes energy-efficient practices, empowering consumers to make informed decisions about their electricity usage.
